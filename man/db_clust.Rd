\usage{
db_clust(
  mode = "partition",
  engine = "dbscan",
  radius = NULL,
  min_points = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A single character string for the type of model. The only
possible value for this model is "partition".}

\item{engine}{A single character string specifying what computational engine
to use for fitting. The engine for this model is \code{"dbscan"}.}

\item{radius}{Positive double, Radius drawn around points to determine core-points and cluster assignments (required)}

\item{min_points}{Positive integer, Minimum number of points required to form a core-point (required)}
}
\value{
A \code{db_clust} cluster specification.
}
\description{
\code{db_clust} defines a model that fits clusters based on areas with observations
that are densely packed together using the DBSCAN algorithm

There are multiple implementations for this model, and the implementation is
chosen by setting the model engine. The engine-specific pages for this model
are listed below.

\subsection{What does it mean to predict?}{

To predict the cluster assignment for a new observation, we determine if a point
is within the radius of a core point. If so, we predict the same cluster as the core point.
If not, we predict the observation to be an outlier.
